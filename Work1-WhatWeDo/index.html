            <h1>Big Industries with Big Challenges</h1>
            <h3>Learning from the leaders in telecoms</h3>
            <p>
              Since 1990, the telecoms industry has been a key contributor to
              global economic development and it remains one of the largest
              employment industries in the world. Although mobile and smart tech
              currently lead the way, revenues from fixed broadband and PC
              internet continue to grow, reflecting the preference for high
              speed cable and fibre. Managing the effects of convergence and the
              rapid rise of data is increasingly important.
              <br />
              <br />
              Wyze2 partners have successfully managed billions of dollars of
              revenues for telecoms operations with many successes in countries
              that lack a structured business environment, banking system,
              regulation, or technical, operational and marketing capacity.
              <br />
              <br />
              While communications are essential for economic development,
              strong demand from emerging markets, rapid roll-out programmes and
              increasing sector complexity can shorten available development
              time leaving process gaps.
              <br />
              <br />
              Despite good intentions, this means that senior management,
              including the Board of Directors, can find themselves dealing with
              revenue loss, increased costs and, potentially, cases of
              corruption, fraud and bribery. Wyze2 makes its experience of
              managing this type of situation available to help build more
              robust and responsive operations.
